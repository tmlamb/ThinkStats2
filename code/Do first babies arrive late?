Do first babies arrive late?

The results of the survey data show that, on average, first babies arrive later than subsequent babies. However, the effect is too low to support the claim that first babies arrive "late". The following are the mean lengths of all live births, first live births, and subsequent live births:
Live Births: 		38.56 weeks
First Pregnancy: 	38.60 weeks
Other Pregnancies:	38.52 weeks

The standard deviation for pregnancy length on all live births is 2.7 weeks. This means that it is common for any pregnancy to complete within 2.7 weeks of the mean of 38.56 weeks. The difference between the average First pregnancy and Other pregnancies of just .08 weeks (13 hours) is not significant enough in relation to the standard deviation to support the claim that first babies arrive late.
